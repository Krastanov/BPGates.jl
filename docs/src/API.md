## States

Use [`BellState`](@ref) to represent a tensor product of Bell states.

## Operations

The gate you will need is [`BellGate`](@ref) which provides the most general Bell-preserving gate. It is built out of smaller gates.

For measurements use [`BellMeasure`](@ref) which provides coincidence measurements.

The `QuantumClifford.apply!` function and company (e.g. `mctrajectory`) can be used for these operations.
