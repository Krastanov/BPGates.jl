## States

Use [`BellState`](@ref) to represent a tensor product of Bell states.

We can represent only Bell states. Here is the basis being used:

| `BPGates` notation| Stabilizer tableaux | Kets | in X basis | in Y basis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|`00`|`+XX +ZZ`|`∣00⟩+∣11⟩`|`∣++⟩+∣--⟩`|`∣i₊i₋⟩+∣i₋i₊⟩`|
|`01`|`+XX -ZZ`|`∣01⟩+∣10⟩`|`∣++⟩-∣--⟩`|`∣i₊i₊⟩-∣i₋i₋⟩`|
|`10`|`-XX +ZZ`|`∣00⟩-∣11⟩`|`∣+-⟩+∣-+⟩`|`∣i₊i₊⟩+∣i₋i₋⟩`|
|`11`|`-XX -ZZ`|`∣01⟩-∣10⟩`|`∣+-⟩-∣-+⟩`|`∣i₊i₋⟩-∣i₋i₊⟩`|

You can convert between these descriptions using
- `BPGates` to stabilizer state with `QuantumClifford.Stabilizer(bpgates_state)`
- stabilizer state to ket with `QSymbolics.stab_to_ket`

## Operations

Most often you would only need [`CNOTPerm`](@ref) as an operation type. There is a [documentation section dedicated to it](@ref cnotlike-gates). It is of the following form:

```@raw html
<img style="width:50%" src="../a_good_bp_gate.png">
```

The most general gate is [`BellGate`](@ref). It is built out of smaller gates. It is of the following form:

```@raw html
<img style="width:50%" src="../general_bp_gate.png">
```

For measurements use [`BellMeasure`](@ref) which provides coincidence measurements as described in [their section of the documentation](@ref measurements).

For noisy operations you can use TODO.

The `QuantumClifford.apply!` function and company (e.g. `mctrajectory`) can be used for these operations.
